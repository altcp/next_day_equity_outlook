# Next Business Day Equity Outlook

A command line tool that provides a quantitative outlook for the next business day.

## Overview

The tool retrieves price information for the equity instrument of your choice. It then automates the basic quantitative work. What you will see as a result of this automation is the outlook for the next business day.

You can for example, use a Raspberry Pi or the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
In the Linux Terminal navigate to the base folder:

1.To first install required dependencies, TYPE: pip install -r requirements
2.To run the CLI, TYPE: bash run.sh

To configure this, navigate to the config subfolder and edit the config.yml file - Instructions Within.
To visualise your choice of instrument run the jupyter notebook, EDA.ipynb in the base folder.

## Discussion

I aim to write simple and clean code so that others can maintain or append with ease. Sponsoring me helps others navigate better and with simplicity as i can focus on delivering a better product or thing rather than paying the bills like many.

## Disclaimer

Ideal Condition(s) are a set of assumptions taken in some model(s). The world we live in is seldom or never ideal. Making considered or control assumptions simplifies the complex world we live in. The techniques being automated here are not immune to such assumptions or assumptions in general.

The outlook provided by the automation is therefore not definative in nature but indicative with varying degree of error. It is up to the user to make the necessary inference.

Nonetheless, everyone should excercise caution when reviewing the output of the automation and should seek independent financial advice when unsure before making any type of financial decision(s).

I bear no responsibilty for any loss or financial loss incurred by you or by anyone as a result of providing this automation.

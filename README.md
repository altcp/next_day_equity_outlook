# Next Business Day Outlook

A command line tool that provides a quantitative outlook for the next business day.

## Overview

The tool retrieves price information for the equity instrument of your choice. It then automates the basic quantitative work. What you will see as a result of this automation is the outlook for the next business day.

## Instructions

You can for example, use a Raspberry Pi or the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\

In the Linux Terminal navigate to the base folder:\

1.To first install required dependencies, TYPE: pip install -r requirements.txt\

2.To run the CLI, TYPE: bash run.sh\

To configure this, navigate to the config subfolder and edit the config.yml file - Instructions Within.\

To visualise your choice of instrument run the jupyter notebook, eda.ipynb in the base folder.\
You can do this in the Linux Terminal after navigating to your base folder, TYPE: jupyter lab

## Discussion

I aim to write clear, simple and clean code so that others can maintain or append with ease. Sponsoring me helps others navigate better and with simplicity as it allows me to focus on delivering a better product or thing than on paying the bills.\

## Disclaimer

Ideal Condition(s) are a set of assumptions taken in some model(s). The world we live in is seldom or never ideal. Making considered or control assumptions simplify the complex world we live in and such is often or can be the manner in which the scientific community communicates.\

The techniques being automated here are not immune to such assumptions or assumptions in general.\

The outlook provided by the automation is therefore not definative in nature but indicative with varying degree(s) of error. This is the general case or the case for all types of financial analysis. Without tired and tested Artifical Intelligence, it is up to the user to make the necessary inference and to exercise prudence in execution.\

Nonetheless, everyone should exercise caution when reviewing the output of the automation and should seek independent financial advice when unsure before making any type of financial decision(s).\

I bear no responsibilty for any loss or financial loss incurred by you or by anyone as a result of providing this automation.\

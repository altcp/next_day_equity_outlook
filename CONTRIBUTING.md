# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owner(s) of this repository before making a change. <br/><br/>

Kindly defer contribution until you have a full idea of what we hope to achieve for the general public. This is so that your contribution(s) can be fully measured and attributed. Observation of this can be seen in the open source organization(s) that I am part of. <br/><br/>

In general, when I or WE use your contribution or your code sharing online, it will be attributed to you via comments in the code that displays your personal url or github page or if you wish to stay annoymous, a handle of your choice. <br/><br/>

Please kindly alert me if you are uncomfortable with your code sharing being used or as matter of expectation, attribution to you personally. Any participation must follow a code of conduct. Further details will be shared when some form of organization is factually reached and my code sharing is ported over. <br/><br/>

Thank you. <br/><br/><br/>
